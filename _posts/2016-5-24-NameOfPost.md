title: How to view code!

Accessing the page source code for a web page is the easy part. Reading that code can be pretty difficult. A detailed HTML tutorial can help a beginner recognize a lot of the tags and language in a page source code view, and learning more about new web coding technologies like XML (Extended Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) will make what’s written in the page source code even more transparent.


Page source code can be difficult enough to read let alone parse what is being viewed. 

Page code readers might find it helpful to add a little white space into their page view. Copy and paste the page source code into a word processing document, and then break the code up into little modules by inserting paragraph breaks and empty lines in between code portions. This will make it easier to identity what’s going on in each part of the code.
Be aware that not all the code may be HTML. There might be CSS, XML, and/or JavaScript mixed in.
